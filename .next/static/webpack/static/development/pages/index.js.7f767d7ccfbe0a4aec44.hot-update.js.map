I spent a few years working in logistics but always felt the call of the tech community.  I finally decided to dive in and have loved every minute of my time as a developer.  I love finding solutions to complex problems, coming up with the most efficient way to do things, and  building effective and efficient apps.  When I'm not coding I love to watch movies and even host a podcast discussing film!
